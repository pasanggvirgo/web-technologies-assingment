    <h2>About Google Search Engine</h2>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Search Engine Link</a>
    <p>There are many other search engines which are as follows:</p>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>Bing</li>
            <li>Yahoo</li>
            <li>DuckDuckGo</li>
            <li>Baidu</li>
            <li>Naver</li>
            <li>Ask.com</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>Even if there are lots of search engines available, I use <b><i>Google search engine</i></b> mostly.</p>
